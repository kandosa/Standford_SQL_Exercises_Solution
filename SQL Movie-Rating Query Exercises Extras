join Reviewer using(rID)
where Movie.director = Reviewer.name

Q3
Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing "The".)

Q5
For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order.

from Rating as r1, Rating as r2, Reviewer as rv1, Reviewer as rv2
where r1.rID = rv2.rID
and r2.rID = rv1.rID
and r1.mID = r2.mID
and rv1.name != rv2.name
and rv1.name < rv2.name
