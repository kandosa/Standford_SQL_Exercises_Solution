Q1
It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler.

delete from HighSchooler
where HighSchooler.grade = 12

Q2
If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple.

delete from Likes
where Likes.ID1 in
(
	select f.ID2
	from Friend as f
	where f.ID1 = Likes.ID2
)
and Likes.ID2 in
(
	select l.ID2
	from Likes as l
	where l.ID1 = Likes.ID1
)
and Likes.ID1 not in
(
	select l.ID2
	from Likes as l
	where l.ID1 = Likes.ID2
)

Q3
For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships, friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.)

insert into Friend (ID1, ID2)
select distinct f.ID1 as ID1, fff.ID1 as ID2
from Friend as f, Friend as ff, Friend as fff
where ff.ID1 in
(
	select Friend.ID2
	from Friend
	where Friend.ID1 = f.ID1
)
and ff.ID1 in 
(
	select Friend.ID2
	from Friend
	where Friend.ID1 == fff.ID1
)
and fff.ID1 not in
(
	select Friend.ID2
	from Friend
	where Friend.ID1 = f.ID1
)
and f.ID1 != fff.ID1
